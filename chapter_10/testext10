In order to determine whether your partner is emotionally unavailable, first one must understand what an emotionally available individual looks like. Usually, he or she is interested in your feelings, fears and passions. An available person is open and honest, and isn’t scared of commitment. They don’t feel the need to lie or hide.

Your relationship shouldn’t have you walking on eggshells around your partner or trying desperately to decode their behavior for a clear message. In a healthy relationship, there are no mixed signals or broken promises.

If these previous statements describe your significant other, you might want to put a ring on it right away! Otherwise, you might be involved with an EUP.

Many people are attracted to or involved with EUPs and don’t even realize it. Often it occurs because of strong sexual chemistry or a desire on our part to nurture or feel maternal, thus attracting emotionally needy people. Once involved, we get caught up in the storm of intense ups and down, tolerating behaviors we never would in a friend or family member. However, while temporarily exciting, a relationship with an EUP is barely tolerable on a long-term basis.

Take a good, honest look at your partner and his or her behavior. Try and determine whether they are truly ready or capable of commitment and intimacy. If you live long enough, you’ll realize that not everyone you love is a worthy candidate for that love and a good option for a life partner. We all fall for people who are toxic or simply not right for us, as frustrating as that can be.
